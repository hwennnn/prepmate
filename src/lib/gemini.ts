You are an expert resume parser. Extract information from the following resume text and return it as a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "personalDetails": {
    "firstName": "string",
    "lastName": "string", 
    "email": "string",
    "phoneNumber": "string (omit if not found)",
    "website": "string (omit if not found)",
    "linkedinUrl": "string (omit if not found)",
    "githubUrl": "string (omit if not found)"
  },
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "string",
      "degree": "string",
      "isAttending": boolean,
      "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "gpa": "string (omit if not found)",
      "awards": "string (omit if not found)",
      "coursework": "string (omit if not found)"
    }
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "company": "string",
      "jobTitle": "string",
      "location": "string",
      "isCurrentJob": boolean,
      "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", 
      "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD (omit if isCurrentJob=true)",
      "achievements": ["string", "string"] (omit if not found),
      "technologies": "string (omit if not found)"
    }

    {
      "name": "string",

IMPORTANT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
1. Extract ALL information available in each section - don't leave anything out
2. For education: Include ALL degrees, certifications, courses mentioned
3. For experience: Include ALL jobs, internships, volunteer work
4. For projects: Include ALL projects mentioned with complete details and technologies used
5. For skills: Separate programming languages from frameworks/tools
6. Use actual dates when available, or reasonable estimates based on context
7. For boolean fields like isCurrentJob/isAttending, determine from context (present tense, "current", etc.)
8. Extract URLs carefully - look for LinkedIn, GitHub, personal websites, project URLs

MISSING VALUE HANDLING (CRITICAL):
- For REQUIRED fields (firstName, lastName, email, institution, degree, company, jobTitle, location, startDate): Always extract or provide reasonable defaults
- For OPTIONAL fields, OMIT the field entirely from JSON if information is not found in resume:
  * personalDetails: phoneNumber, website, linkedinUrl, githubUrl
  * education: gpa, awards, coursework  
  * experience: endDate (when isCurrentJob=true), achievements, technologies
  * projects: url, achievements, technologies
  * skills: languages, frameworks (omit entire fields if no skills section found)
- NEVER include fields with undefined, null, or empty values - completely omit them from JSON
- This ensures valid JSON that can be parsed without errors

DATE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Education: BOTH startDate and endDate are ALWAYS required (even if currently attending)
- Experience: startDate is ALWAYS required
- Experience: endDate is REQUIRED only if isCurrentJob is false (past positions)
- Experience: endDate should be empty string "" if isCurrentJob is true (current positions)
- For currently attending education, use estimated graduation date for endDate
- Always provide dates in YYYY-MM-DD format

PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- "description": What the project IS - a brief explanation of the project's purpose, functionality, or what it does
- "achievements": What you DID or ACCOMPLISHED in the project - specific results, metrics, improvements, or notable implementations
- ONLY include achievements if there are actual accomplishments listed (not just descriptions)
- If the project section only has a brief description without specific accomplishments, leave achievements as an empty array []

FORMATTING RULES FOR ACHIEVEMENTS:
- achievements should be an ARRAY of strings, not a single string
- Each bullet point should represent a specific accomplishment or result
- Remove bullet point symbols (â€¢, -, *, etc.) from each achievement
- Clean up each achievement to be a complete, well-formatted sentence
- Do NOT join achievements into a single paragraph - keep them as separate array elements
- Only include items that show what you accomplished, not what the project does
- Examples of GOOD achievements: ["Increased performance by 40%", "Reduced load time from 3s to 500ms", "Implemented OAuth authentication", "Led team of 3 developers"]
- Examples of what should go in description instead: "A web application for managing tasks", "Mobile app built with React Native"

Resume text to parse:

Return only the JSON object, no additional text or formatting.`;
